This code quiz includes multiple choice questions on a landing page UI. There is a call-to-action button called Start Quiz. Once you clicked that you will be able to see question with three possible choices A, B & C to choose an answer among them. Only one choice is correct. So, the candidates need to choose the correct answer for the question they are presented with. Besides, this code quiz is using a timer thereby it's timed code quiz with countdown of time. So, there is only 10 seconds for each question to answer. If the students did not answer the question in ten seconds, then the quiz will move to the next question automatically. Also, there is a time subtractions if you answered the questions in a couple of seconds, you will move to next question.

Furthermore, this app stores the high score in the local storage by the time finished the quiz with user initials.
